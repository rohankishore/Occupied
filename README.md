## The Summary

This is a first-person psychological horror game set inside a large, decaying hotel. There are no objectives, no map, and no guidance. Each room contains ordinary things—beds, lights, furniture, doors—but the building observes how you move through them. It tracks hesitation, avoidance, familiarity, and repetition, and slowly alters itself in response. Floors feel similar but never identical. Rooms you recognize behave differently when revisited. Lights offer visibility but attract attention, and darkness distorts space rather than hiding it. Violence and human remains appear not as spectacle, but as aftermath—quiet, persistent, and difficult to unsee. The hotel does not try to scare you quickly. It waits, adapts, and converges on your behavior until the environment feels less like a place and more like something that has learned how you exist inside it.
